## Introduction

This is a simple *Pythonic* full text search (FTS) web app powered by **SQLITE3 FTS5**. It should work on many Unix-based platforms, including Termux app on Android OS.

The database files indexed by this Python web app can also be used with this [PHP FTS](https://github.com/vpnry/fts) app.

> Please note that this web app is NOT INTENDED to meet the security or performance requirements for an online production server. Please refer to the [limitations](#limitation) section below for more information.

## Installation

Your device should have `python3`. 

+ Method 1

This is the recommended method. Note that your device must have `git` installed. If you don't have it, you may want to consider using `method 2` below.

```bash
python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/vpnry/pftswebapp.git#egg=pftswebapp

```

+ Method 2

Or download this file [dist/pftswebapp-0.0.2.tar.gz](dist/pftswebapp-0.0.2.tar.gz), then `cd` to its dir and run:

```python 
python3 -m pip install ./pftswebapp-0.0.2.tar.gz
```

## Example usage

+ Consider this localhost directory tree:

```text

localhost
├── this_file_will_not_be_indexed.txt
├── website_1
│   ├── file.html
│   └── file.txt
└── website_2
    ├── file.html
    ├── file.txt
    └── sub_dir
        ├── file.html
        └── file.txt
```

+ Create an `example_app.py` file with this snippet: 

```python

import os
from pftswebapp import web_fts, send_from_directory

# document_root should not be named as 'static'

document_root = 'localhost'
app = web_fts(document_root)

cwd = os.path.join(os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__)), document_root)

# serve static files in document_root


@app.route(f'/{document_root}/<path:request_pat>', methods=['POST', 'GET'])
def serve_static(request_pat):
    print('Requesting:', request_pat)

    # use cwd; relative path document_root will yeild not found errors
    return send_from_directory(cwd, request_pat)

# app.run(debug=True) runs slower
app.run(debug=False)


```

+ Then run the app: `python3 example_app.py`. The app will ignore all first-level files under `localhost/file.*` and will only index the directories specified under `localhost/dirname`. In this example, it will recursively index `website_1` and `website_2` and save them as `website_1.sqlite3` and `website_2.sqlite3` in the `indexed_database` directory.
    
+ Open a standard web browser and enter the address displayed in the terminal (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`) to access the app.
    
+ To stop the app, press `Ctrl + C`.
    
+ If you want to index only a few selected directories, please refer to the [demo_selected_dir](demo_selected_dir.py) file.


## Tips
 
> There are many robust FTS desktop apps available for computers that offer more features. We recommend using them instead.

### Termux Android app

Download and install the Termux app and the Termux Widget app from the F-Droid store (for newer versions). Once installed, use the Termux Widget to place a shortcut on the phone's home screen for easy access.

To create shortcut, in Termux, create `~/.shortcuts/pyfts.sh` file with the following contents:

```bash 

# ~/.shortcuts/pyfts.sh

echo "Starting Python FTS"
cd /storage/emulated/0/python_fts/

termux-open http://127.0.0.1:5000

python3 example_app.py 

```


Then `chmod +777 ~/.shortcuts/pyfts.sh`


+ `/storage/emulated/0/python_fts/` is the place where we created `example_app.py`.


To launch the app, click on the `pyfts` shortcut on the phone's home screen using the Termux widget. Note that if the web address was opened before the server started, you'll need to refresh the web browser to access the app.


### On iOS/iPadOS

- To run the [PHP FTS app](https://github.com/vpnry/fts) on iOS/iPadOS, I use the `phpwin` app, which is faster and more convenient. The indexed database files of this web app are compatible with it.
  
- You can also try using this web app on the `iSH` app.
  
- For easy access to the app, you can create a shortcut on the home screen using the Apple Shortcuts app.


## Limitation

- Please note that this offline and quick implementation web app is **not suitable** for meeting security or performance requirements for an online production server.
    
- The app will only recognize new directories, and it will not detect additional files added to indexed directories. To re-index the directories, you'll need to delete the old indexed `.sqlite3` file and restart the app.
    
- The app can currently only handle `.txt`, `.html`, and `.htm` file formats. To process other file formats, you can use tools like **Apache Tika** to convert them to text `.txt` or `.html` first. Alternatively, you can modify the `indexer.py` file, add more dependencies to handle additional file formats.
